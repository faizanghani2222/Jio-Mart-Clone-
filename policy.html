                    not supported by valid documents or data retention is required by the applicable law or law
                    enforcement requests or under any judicial proceedings or it is extremely difficult to implement
                    (such as requests related to backup copies or if a new system is required to process the request or
                    change of technical design) or risks the privacy of other users.</p>
